# Software Engineering for Message Passing Parallel Clusters

This is a simple paper prepared to review the literature for the topics in the term of message passing clusters.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we briefly address the computer clusters and Beowulf cluster being the first precedent of them. 
We also discuss the key attributes of a cluster and well-known parallel architectures. 
We make a list of message passing techniques and describe the most popular message passing methods in a comparable manner. 
We advert to the testing of message passing parallel programs in a nutshell.
